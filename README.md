# Magento 2 template builder boilerplate
This boilerplate's goal is to take apply our current workflow into Magento 2 template authoring. To achieve that, this boilerplate acts as a Magento 2 module, which then builds the actual Magento 2 template with the proper directory structure. This allows us to use our old workflow without interfering with the structure that Magento 2 needs e.g. for files inheritance to work.
